//Challenge3
//ðŸŽ²The objective of the game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces in 5 die rolls.
// 1. Roll the die, generate a random number bet 1 and 6.
// 2. After each roll, tell the player at which position are they and how much spaces should be travelled to win.
// 3. Repeat this 4 additional times, so that it count to 5 die rolls.
// 4. If the player gets 20 spaces before 5 rolls, they win!
// 5. If the player is over 20 spaces or less than 20 spaces, they lose!
// Hint:There are only 20 spaces in the board, so you cant go beyond 20.
